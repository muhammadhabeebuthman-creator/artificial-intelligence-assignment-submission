# Mastermind AI (Strict Version)

This is a browser-based Mastermind game with animated guesses and feedback dots.  
The game demonstrates a step-by-step reveal of guesses and feedback, similar to the classic Mastermind board game.

## Features

- Animated colored pegs appear row by row.
- Black feedback dots indicate correct color and position.
- Solved message appears when the secret code is cracked.
- Fully implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Strict version: feedback only shows exact matches (color + position).

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `style.css` – CSS styling for the board, pegs, and feedback
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for animations and feedback

## How to Run Locally

1. **Download the ZIP file**
   - Click the **Download ZIP** button on GitHub to download the repository.

2. **Extract the files**
   - Extract all files from the ZIP into a single folder on your computer.

3. **Open the game**
   - Double-click `index.html` or right-click → **Open with** → choose your browser.
   - The game will run automatically: colored pegs appear row by row, followed by feedback dots.

### Notes

- Keep all files together in the same folder; otherwise, the HTML will not find the CSS and JS.
- Works in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
